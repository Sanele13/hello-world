This is me learning how to create repositories in Github :) 

Hi there,

My name is Sanele Mpangalala. I have been writing code since I started engineering, and I'm only starting to use Github now :) I'm just tring to keep up with what is going on in the programming world, and also I want to use this platform to save all the code I'll be writing using the different languages I'll be learning. My goal is to learn a lot of language, and be fluent in them. So this is the begining of what is going to be a great thing. :) Let's geddit!
